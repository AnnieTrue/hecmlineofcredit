		<h1>Thinking of a Reverse Mortgage?</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="section3">

		<h1>Reverse mortgages are not for everyone but there is no reason to fear them. </h1>

		<div>It‚Äôs just a mortgage. The fact that FHA insures them should tell you that the Federal Government sees this is an important tool to keep available for senior American homeowners. It is something both parties agree on.</div>
<br>
		<div>The most important thing to remember about Reverse Mortgage is the word Mortgage. It is a mortgage, in many ways like any other mortgage. Each month interest accrues on the open balance. With typical, <i>forward mortgages</i>, you would send a monthly payment that would pay that month‚Äôs interest accrual and something towards the principal. With a Reverse Mortgage you are <i>not required</i> to make monthly payments for principal and interest, (but you could if you wanted to), for as long as you live in your home. The interest each month is added to the loan balance and that balance grows instead of reducing. That‚Äôs the ‚ÄúReverse‚Äù part.</div>

				<h1>Will a Reverse Mortgage cause me to lose my home?</h1>

				<div>The risk of ‚Äúlosing your home‚Äù with a reverse mortgage is almost identical to the risk when you have no mortgage. Think of it this way, if you have no mortgage can you be foreclosed on? If you answered no, try not paying your property tax for a couple of years. üòä </div>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h1>What are the requirements for a Reverse Mortgage?</h1>
		
		<div>With a Reverse Mortgage, you are required to pay your property taxes, just like if you have no mortgage. <i>So, that part is the same.</i></div>
<br>
		<div>With a Reverse Mortgage, you ARE required to keep your home insured. If you have no mortgage you are NOT required to carry insurance but you‚Äôre at great risk if you don‚Äôt. <i>That is a difference but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree that homeowners insurance is an absolute necessity.</i></div>
<br>
		<div>There is even a program within the reverse mortgage that allows you to have the bank pay your tax and insurance if you choose to.</div>	
<br>			
		<div>The only other requirements are that you live there, the home with the reverse mortgage must be your primary residence, and you must maintain the property. If the roof is leaking you need to fix it. If you get termites you need to treat for them. All things you would do anyway, right?</div>

				<h1>Do I need good credit to qualify for a Reverse Mortgage?</h1>
				<div>You can often qualify for a Reverse Mortgage even if you‚Äôve experienced negative credit events. Your credit score is not considered in a Reverse Mortgage application.</div>
